A class loader is an object that is responsible for loading classes. 
The class ClassLoader is an abstract class. 	

Every Class object contains a reference to the ClassLoader that defined it 	

The ClassLoader class uses a delegation model to search for classes and resources. 
Each instance of ClassLoader has an associated parent class loader. When requested to 
find a class or resource, a ClassLoader instance will delegate the search for the class 
or resource to its parent class loader before attempting to find the class or resource itself. 
The virtual machine's built-in class loader, called the "bootstrap class loader",
does not itself have a parent but may serve as the parent of a ClassLoader instance.
